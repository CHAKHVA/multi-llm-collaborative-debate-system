    "question": "Three gods A, B, and C are called, in no particular order, True, False, and Random. True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. You must determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question must be put to exactly one god. The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for yes and no are 'da' and 'ja', in some order. You do not know which word means which. What is the first question you should ask to ensure you can solve the puzzle?",
    "ground_truth": "Ask god B: 'If I asked you 'Is A Random?', would you say 'ja'?' (If B answers 'ja', then C is not Random. If B answers 'da', then A is not Random. This isolates a non-random god to ask the next questions to.)"
